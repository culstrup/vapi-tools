# VAPI Tools Open Source Project Status Report

## Project Overview
VAPI Tools is a Raycast script for quickly extracting and analyzing transcripts from VAPI (Voice API) voice assistant calls. The tool is designed to simplify the process of gathering voice assistant transcripts for further analysis, allowing users to extract data with a single keyboard shortcut rather than manually copying and pasting from multiple calls.

## Completed Work

### Repository Setup
- Created GitHub repository at https://github.com/culstrup/vapi-tools
- Set up proper file structure with documentation, screenshots, and code files
- Added MIT License with copyright notice for "2025 GSD at Work LLC"
- Created comprehensive README.md with installation and usage instructions
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md with contributor guidelines
- Set up initial GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing

### Code Improvements
- Enhanced platform compatibility for clipboard operations (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Added extensive error handling and logging
- Created a preload script to improve first-run performance
- Implemented Python virtual environment setup and management
- Added proper type hints and docstrings to all functions
- Ensured PEP 8 style compliance

### Testing and Validation
- Created unit and integration tests with pytest
- Set up GitHub Actions CI workflow to test on Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11
- Fixed platform-specific tests to ensure they pass in CI environments
- Added test mocking for clipboard operations to work in headless environments
- Created a validation script to verify code quality

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive step-by-step instructions with screenshots
- Created detailed performance tips and troubleshooting section
- Added command-line usage examples with all available options
- Documented cross-platform compatibility considerations

## Remaining Tasks

### Blog Post Integration
- Update the README.md to include the link to the VAPI blog post once it's published
- The blog post will highlight how this tool enhances productivity when working with VAPI voice assistants

### GitHub Repository Configuration
- Update GitHub repository settings with appropriate topics and description (requires login)
- Add more detailed documentation for contributors if needed
- Continue monitoring GitHub Actions test results across different Python versions

## Current Status
The project is ready for public use and has been successfully published to GitHub. All the core functionality works across different platforms, and the documentation provides clear instructions for installation and usage. The remaining tasks are primarily related to finalizing the documentation with the blog post link and configuring the GitHub repository settings, which requires owner login.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor repository for issues and pull requests from the community
2. Update the blog post link when it's published
3. Consider adding more examples and use cases to the documentation
4. Explore integration with additional tools beyond Raycast
